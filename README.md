# DarnWDL - an open source WDL reader

WDL is used by Taiwan government and is a proprietary format. It was
designed to be portable like PDF, but it never achieve its goal due
to its close-source nature.
We are decoding this format and write free readers.
Join us and help us, thanks.

The current format is written in docs/format.md.

## Programming Language

This project was based on GTK2. But due to GTK2 is deprecated we port it
to Java and using Swing. The GTK2 code is still left in this repo for
reference. Contributions please go for the Java version.

## Old OpenFoundry repo

This project was hosted in OpenFoundry, an code repository hosted in Taiwan.
But it was down for a long time.
